# react-native-web-storybook-typescript
WIP for a monorepo boilerplate including 3 packages

- universal: a react storybook to develop and test your React-Native components in isolation.
- web: create-react-app project with react-native-web to import universal components (from `universal`) and render them in the browser.
- native: TODO react-native project to import universal components (from `universal`) and render them on mobile device natively.

So the goal is to have one codebase you can run on the web and mobile.
